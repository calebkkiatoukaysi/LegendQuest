# Assets

Every file the game ships or reads, and where it came from. Nothing here was downloaded or recorded:
the art is drawn by `tools/generate_ui.py`, `tools/generate_world.py` and
`tools/generate_characters.py`, the music and sound effects are synthesised by
`tools/generate_audio.py`, the maps are written by hand, and the only outside work is the font, the
MonoGame template files, and a few rules from the SRD 5.1 (credited at the end).
`python tools/check_assets.py` fails if this list and the files on disk ever disagree.

## Text

Content/Spectral/Spectral-Light.ttf - Spectral font created by Production Type, released on Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) under the SIL Open Font License

Content/Spectral/Spectral-Medium.ttf - Spectral font created by Production Type, released on Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) under the SIL Open Font License

Content/Spectral/OFL.txt - the SIL Open Font License text and copyright notice for Spectral, redistributed alongside the font as that licence requires (copied into the build output, so it ships with the game)

Content/spectral-title.spritefont - written by Caleb Kiatoukaysi for Legend Quest, from the MonoGame SpriteFont template; names Spectral Light at 92pt by relative path, so the build uses the font shipped in Content/Spectral/ rather than whatever is installed

Content/spectral-ui.spritefont - written by Caleb Kiatoukaysi for Legend Quest, from the MonoGame SpriteFont template; Spectral Medium at 26pt, letterspaced

Content/spectral-detail.spritefont - written by Caleb Kiatoukaysi for Legend Quest, from the MonoGame SpriteFont template; Spectral Light at 17pt, letterspaced

## The scripts

tools/pixels.py, tools/generate_ui.py, tools/generate_world.py, tools/generate_characters.py, tools/generate_audio.py - every asset above that says "drawn procedurally" or "synthesised" comes out of these; pixels.py is the PNG writer and colour helpers the art scripts share. They need nothing but CPython (3.12 or newer for generate_audio.py), and every one is seeded, so a rerun gives the same files

tools/check_assets.py - written by Caleb Kiatoukaysi for Legend Quest, checks this file, Content/Content.mgcb and the files on disk against each other

## SRD 5.1

The rules use a few things from the 5e System Reference Document: the six ability scores and how a
score turns into a modifier, the class names Fighter, Rogue, Cleric and Wizard with their hit dice,
hit points at first level, and the standard array the party's scores are spread from. The names of
the people and places are mine.
